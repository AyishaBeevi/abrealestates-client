#  AB Real Estates — Full-Stack MERN Application

**Production-deployed real estate platform** with role-based dashboards for **users, agents, and admins**, built to reflect **real UAE property workflows**.

🔗 **Live:** https://abrealestates.vercel.app/
🔗 **API:** Node.js + MongoDB (Render)

---

##  What This App Does

* Users browse verified property listings
* Agents manage listings & enquiries
* Admins approve properties & manage users
* Secure role-based access across the platform

Built with **production constraints in mind**, not as a demo project.

---

##  Auth & Security (Key Focus)

* JWT authentication
* Role-based access (User / Agent / Admin)
* Protected frontend routes
* Backend authorization middleware
* Unauthorized access handling (401 / redirects)

---

##  Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React (Vite), React Router, React Query, Tailwind
**Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JWT
**Media:** Cloudinary
**Deployment:** Vercel  + Render

---

##  Real Production Issues Solved

* Fixed 401 errors caused by auth mismatch
* Implemented role-guarded API queries
* Resolved SPA routing 404s in production (Vercel)
* Standardized auth state using a single context
* Debugged runtime crashes in minified builds

These were solved **after deployment**, not hypothetically.
